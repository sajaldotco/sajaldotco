I am not neutral, always on the side of righteousness. I don't understand politics. When I say against BNP, I am an Awami broker, and when I write against the League I am a traitor. Atheist Think I'm atheist, believer believe I'm also a beliver; But I wanted to be a better human. Sometimes I am the treasure of my parents, this is the homelessness of the people, because I am the obedient child of this nature. So I don't have any pain, no sorrow or no joy, because I am zero. I created from zero, and sometimes there are many things that are created from me. Don't panic me, though I'm afraid that I am in a hurry. Sometimes You want to kill me, but I am deadly long ago. My educational institutions & certificates told me Engineer, but I want to be a philosopher. The time is seeking to dissolve me in this universe but I want freedom, I seek eternal happiness.

You divided me into Hindus, Sudra, but I wanted to be an intelligent creature in the evolving world. You wanted me to do politics and bounded man in family, but I'm only for this continuous for the sake of nature. You have sometimes wanted to make me a householder, but I am free, constant truth. There is no boundaries of humanity, no invisible sparrows. Yet you want to stop me from going on in the pale of religion, at the border of the country, but I wanted to be free. You say that there is a festive gathering in faith, far beyond the argument. I say that knowledge leads to the knowledge, people become unconscious in faith. You want me to be like you, but I want to be like me. I want to fly in a white cloud like a free bihanga. So I sing, the human freedom song. I can not eat a bribe, I can not eat, so I sing, enjoying the bribe can not enjoy the songs of joy I sing songs of love to people in the exchange of sorrow, in exchange for peace and happiness.
