I have been visiting India for a few days, I have been spending some time traveling around Canning, Piyali, Sonarpur, Garia, Jadavpur and Salt LakeCity. Over the past week, I can not sleep a lot in the night or day, I can not talk to anyone right. Maybe there is something quiet inside the house, but I can not even see TV because of the word terror because of terrorism. Mike, loudspeakers and chocolate wizard have created a boring atmosphere in the surroundings. I have no objection to having fun or making fun until it does not cause any harm to me. To be honest, at this moment I have psychologically distorted, for very high levels of words.

Generally, people can not sleep if the sound level is 45 dB. If 80-to-85 dB is found in a long way, the human hearing sensation begins to suffer and if the condition is 120, then ear pain is felt. Children under 3 years of age may lose their hearing if there are several hours in front of 100 DB words. Generally loudspeakers or mics are generated at a level of 100 dB. Outside the limit, noise pollution destroys hearing power, which can destroy anyone's mental balance. Sound pollution is also a cause of irritable mood, it also causes lung damage, obstruction of children's intelligence, and lack of education in their studies.

Usually India is a Hindu majority country, at the junction of small big temples. Temporary temples were also built on the occasion of various monsoon worship. And these temples mean Mike or loudspeakers with high volume DJ. I did not see Kolkata during Durga Puja, but I saw Kaliipuja in Dipabli. For a 5-year-old child, it takes a minimum sum of Tk 1000 for a bet. Diwali lighting festival is good as long as it is limited to light. But the problem is that there are over-the-counter sound pollutants. Never seen or seen some boys of distorted rituals who are betting on dogs or other animals.

Someone will pray but what is the relationship with the song in high volume with him. I knew it was silent to pray but here I have to come and see the definition of prayer to be changed. Here is how to make an invisible competition more than someone who can make more noise. So what should I say is that it is not as much as Thakur Pujya Pujo words more than that. I have heard that there are some principles of using microphysic or loudspeakers, but in reality I did not see any application. And if I talk about these things, then I am opposed to religion-based, yes-noise pollution, if there is a religious pattern. Maybe that's why I am a potentially astrologer but it is important that you are participating in noise pollution. So in the end, one thing is to say that you should refrain from any kind of noise pollution, encourage others in this regard, and give a good future to your future fertility.
