I'm afraid
The number of the hierarchy is increasing all the time around, corruption continues to grow at the unimaginable rate, the demand for fair payers is being voiced. Yes, they are, in front of me. We all have the feeling of trade in front of us, and there we never ever have a buyer again the seller and the audience. We were born in the light of the cloak, and the creation of it is a new national problem. Our homelessness, inferiority, fidelity are shaping up in a community backward in evolution. I'm afraid, yes, I'm afraid. No natural disasters, people made up of problems Because these intelligent creatures can create a planned problem or a horrible disaster. In spite of having a rich language culture, we have been competing against others for blind imitation. I see a rude, sick society and ethnic group growing up a little bit in front of my eyes. Yes, knowingly or consciously, we are getting bigger by getting them to earn unjust benefits and harm us. We talk about equality, but never say justice. In any case, we came down in the role of judges, we made the wrong laws themselves, and sometimes the punishment was also progressed. These are the reasons for my fear. 

In today's competition, animals are losing people too, because, in the case of human beings, we are not able to become 100% human beings in human society, in many cases, livestock is being abandoned and human being. I am afraid of social disaster makers, their syndicate, their officers, and employees. The religion (I called it opiate opium) fields are being made in the district by the government and foreign funding. To make power lasting, the regents often try to keep the subordinates inebriate, that is now seen in my country. Because if the ideas of the rulers are overwhelming to obscenity, power will last long. In the same way, a religious system based communalization of the education system, which is able to mentally cripple a generation. All of the teachers' freedom fighters are being assaulted on the street or at the workplace, some case they were being suicided. The civilization is falling in the footsteps of knowledge every day, the limitations of knowledge, the power of power. Thousands of millions of dollars are being stolen here in the eyes of the eyes which are very irrelevant to the authorities. Most deployment jobs do not end at a specific time, in contrast, more budget increases in geometric rates. The development is going on in the name of a terrible looting. All of these are my fears, every time I am attacked with new fear, chasing a fear is another fear. 

Here, the secularism has been eradicated, declaring non-communalism, in the near future, non-communalism will also be eradicated in a democratic way. Today, sculptures and statues mix together in the country, which is the result of social and mental poverty, today's bumper yield is also here. A deep conspiracy to transform the Aegean Green Bangladesh into a desert. And in the fire of this conspiracy, the progressive people's silence is working like petrol. On the other hand, the cultural activities of the people are provoked by the distorted mentality of the people. Looking at the mountains of this country, it seems that in another country it is a different land, and the law is different for it so that they are not the people of this country. Settlers Bangalis today are the idols of Pakistanis. There is the only peace agreement, but its implementation is not done. Recruitment of any government official or employee in the country is not done without a bribe because the bribe has been made valid as 'speed money' here. Today, doing all kinds of immoral acts here, with legitimacy, irregularities become routine day by day. Yes, today all opposition opinion is being suppressed by a law like blasphemy which is also available in Pakistan. For the sake of writing or publication here in the state, people are being hacked to death day after day for the sake of religion. Sometimes a case is being filed against them for the sake of alleged religious beliefs, some bloggers and online activist are being taken away from the country. In such a scary environment, the common people are afraid of it, and I am really scared. 

In the country, the minority communities are being tortured, compared to the past, loss of resources and emigration. Humanity is bound here today in the chain of religion, the Bengali Muslims are today turning into Muslim Bengalis day by day. Most political shops talk about the same thing, they think they are members of the same society. In many cases political halls of political shops appeared in the army, occupied by the state power, by issuing the military rule. Moreover, extra-judicial killings are being organized continuously by the government forces here every year. The power is influencing the court, money power is crouching near justice People are making ointments of the people in the mirror of the nation, they're published false news and giving them fine today. Here, opposition to independence has become narrative and came to be talked about in mainstream media. And most political leaders, who publicly declare unequivocal statements in the media, are at the level of hypocrisy. The woman is believed to be a third-class domestic animal. Although the Prime Minister, the Speaker of the Parliament or the Leader of the Opposition all the women Again, they are hereby certifying the sub-minority certificate for the minor, to reduce the rate of child marriage by reducing marriage age. Women are mostly kept in limitation here.There is no escape from the rape of the five years old from the age of seventy-five years old, it is here that Morality is occupying the place of morality. Again, the victims of torture are not able to seek justice or get the opportunity to commit suicide. In front of the eyes, bad teams are constantly getting heavier here, the changing of society is changing the country's appearance. I'm scared, I'm afraid of all this, yes I'm afraid about my future.
