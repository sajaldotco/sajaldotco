I’m an easy going, hardworking and organized person. My strength is that I can co-operate and work with others very well in any place. My problem has a solution; I will work on a plan. My most friends said I was a progressive and practical person but actually I wasn’t. 

Sometimes I have a lot on my plate, and I must focus on completing my work so I have little time to hang out with friends &amp; relatives or care about my relationships. But the table always has turned when I have free time. I think my weakness is time management, I often get unbalanced between job time and family time.

My hobby is Traveling &amp; I also visited all most 59 district in Bangladesh. I am very keen on experimenting new hardware, software like operating system caring them on my own. I suppose that technology research helps me become more patient and responsible. Besides, I also prefer fiction movie show.

My major expertise telecommunication equipment are BTS, BSC, MSC, M2000, WASN gateway, AAA Server, Router &amp; Firewall. I have also elite skill in Domain Management, Web Hosting (cPanel/WHM), Web development. After all, as a human, I believe in Secularism, freedom of speech and equality in society. Every day, in every way, I am becoming better and better and my short-term goal is to become the better human in this universe.
