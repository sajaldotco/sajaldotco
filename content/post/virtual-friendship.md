Facebook's new friendship is a matter of two clicks, two times to remove it again. Add friend then confirmed to new friends, and unfollow again unfollow, diameter is two clicks. Who will send a friendship request, or who will accept it as a friend, such as someone who has personal rights and rights too. Friendship limit on Facebook is up to 5000. A man can never be well-acquainted with 5000 people in his life or know enough about them. So I think that this 5,000 friends' friendlier limit is too much. And those celebrities have arrangements for pages where their fans or followers can get connected.

Generally, on Facebook we follow what we follow in making friends with strangers, because of a beautiful look, a beautiful stylus or a similar ideology. Again, there are some newcomers who have clicked unorthodoxly, click on different posts and comments without clicking or making friendships. Again, some people's mentality is like Giv and Tech, that means, if someone does not like comments in my post or movie, I would not like to comment on his post. But in many cases, unlike the pre-arranged likes for the difference of ideology, some people also carry their identities with their low mentality.

A few days ago I wrote an open letter to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and published it on my Facebook website and on my personal website. There I have criticized some of his recent work, which is 100 percent true. Maybe my criticism was a bit cumbersome, but there was nothing unhappy in it. After writing this letter, I noticed that the absence of some people in the friend list. Of course, I am also very happy that I have no friendship with all these associates. I have many friends who are Awami League's top division leaders, district or police leaders. I noticed that they did not unfreck me, did not make bad comments, did not say anything in the inbox or did not say anything at the verbal wetlands.

The power that a politician has to live before all is the ability to resist criticism. In this case, my real-life friends have shown patience and I thank them. There are many things people have in constructive criticism, which help them to be more efficient and creative in their later life. If someone gives an opposition opinion that he will be abusive, vicious comments or will have to be suppressed, those who believe and those who do not do politics of the masses. It is important for politicians to keep up with the opinions of everyone if they want to do good politics.
