I and my colleague busy in coffee shop at the GP House, suddenly came to the ears, a senior engineer of type 'Hujur' type told another, it is not okay to read the quran in Bengali. Because, as he says, there are some words or sentences in Arabic whose correct pronunciation is not possible, so it is unbelief. He also said that the first quran translated into Bengali, there was a misguided translation by a disbeliever. Then many authors did not succeed in translating it properly. I asked my colleagues, what do you think about this. He said, "I have no opinion in this regard." I said to him, Look, there are many words in engineering textbooks that no one has ever translated it, but I think any word or sentence is possible to translate. Here he stopped me and said, I have no interest in this. And I think the quran reads and reads 'sunnat' in Arabic.

After two day of Dr.Abhijit Roy murder, most engineers on the fifth floor of GP House saw the joy of victory. There is no such crime in most of the people there. My five-time prayer boss also said that his writing was not correct. My other colleagues went on to share the verses of the quran on Facebook in order to give legitimacy to this murder. At the interval, I told him that if you do not live in the law of your Quran, then why do you pretend to promote this country's law? He told me that before any Muslim, the law of the Qur'an should be obeyed, then something else. Before I saw this Open Space Office to work on pin fall silence, but on that day it was racket full. In most places, his talks, as much as discussed, criticized most of his criticism. According to many, one day the world will be a disbelieving world, where everybody will be Muslims.

When in Turkey the army quotes, I saw bleeding in the heart of most people in the GP House. According to them, Erdan is the container and carrier of Islam, so this crisis means the crisis of the whole Muslim world. My boss wants a military in Bangladesh, he doesn't want a military command in Turkey. According to him, if he also issued military rule in Bangladesh like Pakistan, then the rule of law and justice will be established in the country. One of the objectives of seeking military service in Bangladesh is that most soldiers are Islamic minded and, on the other Turkish coup forces have secular minded. On that day, most of the people there started this act as conspiracies of the Jews. On that day, Erdan is called a hypocrite, many people call me a disbeliever, whereas I always fight against army coups everywhere. When Erdan was able to stop the army's coup, again I saw everyone float in the joy of victory.
