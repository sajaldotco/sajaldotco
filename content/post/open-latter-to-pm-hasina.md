Dear Sheikh Hasina, knows when ordinary people like me open the mouth? When the wall is out of the back. I did not see the Zia's military rule, I did not understand much at Ershad's authoritarian regime, but I saw your authoritarian arbitrary rule. It is obviously fascism. The police and Elite Forces who are carrying you are dancing Shiva's tunes, and you are wearing a tin fasma, or it is a little difficult to understand by your instructions! I have heard that nothing is happening in this country or not. You are said to be.

Education is the backbone of the backbone of teachers and teachers. And you used to teach a teacher, Maidul, for his expression. As my friend Asif said that crossing the Kanchpur bridge, all those who are seen in the important post of the country today do not seem to be good without them. History tells us that no fascist government in the world has been living so long, and although someone has been in power for a long time, history and time have not pardoned him. The ruthless sacrifice of history has to be theirs. You know, in Europe, if you get someone from Nazi forces, you are facing trial.

Your advisor, whom we know as a saint father, published a few days ago, he dipped GMG to the tune of 300 crores. Earlier, thousands of crores of rupees were lost from the stock market, Hallmark and Bangladesh Bank. Your finance minister can avoid liability? Sheikh Hasina, your position in the politics of vengeance is clear now. After all, you dismissed Dr. Eunus as the most senior of the age of Grameen Bank, the age of your Minister's Minister of Finance, how much you think!

Your hatred of politics of vengeance has also prevailed in past when you see that your assistant and a minister of government called the author of the constitution of Bangladesh as Qadiani atheist. Who will eat in private life, who will wear, who will tell or who will follow the religion, it is his freedom of person You said "those who ate voracious and pork" are distorted. I trust people's freedom of expression, according to which you can tell a person as a person, but you can not say it as a head of state. However, this has stopped the expression of human expression through saturna and thirty-two streams. So you do not want to tell the story of development by taking away the freedom of expression of human expression.

I remember when Nasirnagar's house was built two years ago, when you did not say anything about their intentions, then Khulna cricketer gave a home for a good game. I know why; Voting politics, for the majority of centimeters. Even today, your foreign ministry did not say anything against filthy torture on women workers sent to Saudi Arabia, they did not take any action. You know very well how much of our women workers are being victimized. You have not heard any statement about this issue yet, I have heard that you have become half Saudi. I know that when he recognized the independence of Saudi Arabia; After your father's death.

You have broken all of the four principles of Bangladesh constitution, there is no sector in the country, there is no anarchy, you can not avoid its liabilities. The length of time in your body is shown in the same way. Remember when you came to Bangladesh in the 1980s, she came to the airport and she tears He forgot all that! Actually, you have one hand, there is one hand on the throat. When you do not have the path, and when you get the chance, you press the throat. Actually, you or your people in government are skilled from any actors or actress who has acted in Bangla film. You do not need to watch movies when you see your acting.

If you patronize the Rohingyas, then the landlord Hindus, Buddhists, Christians and indigenous people oppressed them, why? It is difficult to understand these for the politics of vote or sometimes you observe circumcision. You have changed many laws that are not popular in these two terms, such as ICT 57 and Section 32, in reality this trend tends to undermine the right to express human opinion. You have amended the Narcotics Control Act, which is the new Income Source of your PIC. Do you know that there is enemy property / vested property law, so that minority Hindus lose their ancestral property! You know, but now you are a Muslim, so the Hindu property seems to be your property, so do not believe !?

Here the Chief Justice is ill and we have to hear from the Law Minister, but why! It is said that he is corrupt, if he was the chief justice of corruption, then any great conservatives had appointed him !? All I understand is that in Hollywood or Bollywood movies, I was killed by one person, the murderer was murdered by someone else, for the testimony of the witnesses, these games are also here. On the other hand, your shipping minister has proved how fast he is and how long his hand is. Wah wah we are playing Talia and her uneducated murkafir circus. Your minister should be engraved with the demise of the minister in the transport sector. Did you know, your transportation mafiaillig has killed a dead person who wasted time by hanging on the road. Your Shahjahan Khan army can not avoid the responsibility of this murder! Again in front of the elections, the old calculations like to know that you need minority votes? Whether hefajat is the supplementary of the vote count! I know that you do not have the mentality of answering these questions of extraordinary people or mentality. Yet I have written and written in my own conscience's bite. If your image is still in the country or abroad, please do not waste it, you are my request to me.
