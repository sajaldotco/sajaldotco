**Rape!**

Now the pages of any newspaper are seen rape! So now the rape level reached the level of the country? And what is the number of rapists in the proportion of the population? At least I do not think so. In my opinion rape was still there and it continues in the same rhyme. The difference now is the fact that it is now more than ever since it was released. People were less afraid of self-esteem than they used to have in the media. When the police did not make any allegations of rape, the news was often not placed in the pages of the magazine. Now the number of print media or online media is much higher than earlier or in some cases social media also plays an important role in the mainstream media. So now a news spreads rapidly and is viral. But the rape that we get here is pre-marital rape, because we do not have enough sense of being married to any of the victims of sexual assault.

If someone is raped in this country, then the finger is taken in front of her or her profession or her profession. Often, the village-level male-dominated society tried to interfere with the marriage of rapists, or in exchange for money which is disgusting. On the other hand, in most Bangladeshi movies, the rape image is presented in such a way that most people find a similar sex pleasure. On the other hand, instead of complaining of rape or suicide, suicide is done which is unfortunate. Again, in real cases, a rapist has to be raped repeatedly during the judicial process. To be raped repeatedly, either on the street or at work, There is a place where there is no rape of women or children including family, school, college or religious place. In order to judge the rape of the country, the door had to go door to door and finally had to commit suicide, Victim had to commit suicide.

The role of media or culture activists who are against rape, they are often raped in many areas. Or the culture of some culture workers was vandalized or harassed for the sake of giving a true speech about rape, for the sake of so-called Megary Sentiment. Today, 10 percent of the families in Bangladesh are also suspected of whether social awareness is created. Due to the culture of non-discrimination today, a child or a woman is not safe even to the brother and father of her own family. but why ? These families were supposed to be their safe haven, so it is important to think now; In the absence of any awareness, they are not safe even with their families? Firstly, consciousness should start from our family. Yes, our genocide is that this rape should be done to stop the terrorism, as well as appropriate punishment to the courts of law.
