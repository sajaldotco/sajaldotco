The weakness of the people is the main tool of the politicians of any state. People in Bangladesh say the majority of people in the plain Muslims, Hindus and tribal people in hills. And with the many ideals of these groups, political shops have traded in different ways. In these three groups, the people of different castes hold different ideologies, in the same way. In the political divide, BNP had succeeded in playing trilogy against India and religion in the past. Awamilig won by using Liberation War and Razakar issue.

In the election campaign of 2001, Propaganda was spread with the BNP and Jamaat, "If Awami League wins, then the Ooh will be heard in the mosque". Most of the country will be sold to India. At that time the lectures would be called "secularism is Religionness", Awami League wants to establish it in the country. The number of people who believed in these beliefs in the country was not low, so the BNP-Jamaat alliance won the vote.

In 2013, some progressive online activists and bloggers launched the Ganajagaran Mancha demanding the execution of war criminal Quader Mollah. At that time the Awami League had direct and indirect consent and cooperation. Later, Ganajagaran Mancha started protesting and protesting against any bad situation in the country. In this situation, the government raised Hefazat Islam to pretend Ganajagaran Manch. Then Awami League won the election by showing people the pledge of trial of war criminals in 2014. And by using the people's sympathies, they make power lasting.

Many racist and discriminatory statements made by Donald Trump before the United States election are actually the result of numerous American thought. He told Michelle is a black monkey and his discrination spece against Muslims, aren't own idology. The victory of the trump poll proves that a large part of the American population is a part of the racist and believe discrimination. So the appointment of Black President to the White House, the presence of the liberal outlook that the Americans introduced in the past is now down.

In India, Narendra Modi used to wear words before being prime minister, when all the Muslim intruders would get out of country. Citizen of Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh will relax the conditions of citizenship. Beef-ban will be banned all over the country. Special conditions will be added to import from China and Pakistan. Even though Modi himself thinks these things, these things are actually a reflection of the thoughts of a large population. So Modi's political business must surely benefit from the business of these people's ideas.

When a large population holds certain ideals (good and evil) in a country, then political parties try it by using the benefits. It happens in most countries. The leaders don't understand the masses of the people who have their own sugarcane with these discriminatory thoughts. Because of the fact that the consumer is bound to that extent. But in this 21st century, religion in the sub-continent's underdeveloped country is a political armor, which is more beneficial by using leaders and influencers.
