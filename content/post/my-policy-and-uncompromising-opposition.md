The biggest failure of my parents is that many times I oppose their different words or decisions. Naturally, I used to stay away from traditional rituals or to refrain from celebrating them. For a while, I refrained from announcing any religious festival. I am only interested in those festivals that are public and those events which are not present in any religious curtain. Generally, the method of giving respect to someone in the Hindu society is to bow down on the feet of someone who is prostrated by hand or bowing down on somebody's feet and then taking the head of the feet after heading. I do not think human beings as human beings have the honor to give me this respect. Imagine why I would like to be respected in other ways by human beings, even if he is more knowledgeable than me! I think there is no need to take a foothold to respect or respect anyone.

There is a tradition in Hindu society that is known as blessing. I don't think it actually has any effect in the actual case. And if there were any effect, then in the big temple or the blessings of the devotees, it is not really necessary to read books. If the mother is not blessed with Saraswati's blessings, then Newton, Einstein, Pythagoras, Euclid, Galileo or Leonardo de Vinci have solved so complex scientific and mathematical problems. If I talk about Elon Mask of the current era, he has not worshiped the world. Maybe he did not listen and heard. But without the blessing of the bureaucracy, this is the chief executive and founder of the HyperLop or SpaceX. Without the blessing of Lakshmi, Bill Gates or Warren Buffett did the world's richest wealthy! Why do people now go to a plastic surgeon without the blessing of Kartik to cure the face! Imagine yourself, ask yourself, your brain is free.

When someone tells me that brother please bless me like this, that is me, I very kindly greet him. I know that there will not be any change in his condition until he or she wishes to change it. Yet, I consciously do it only for the sake of consolation and its morale growth. Congratulations to welcome someone if they get something new. This is my personal freedom that I would like to applaud or wish, and there is no relation to showing my respect or accompanying him. It's a good idea to say goodbye to good night to him, after going to the back of someone with a gentle hand in front of him. Someone asks how you are, some say that you are good in your blessing, he knows that it is a lie. Maybe it is usually for people to make others oily and others to take advantage of them and to get benefit from them. So I have always avoided this humble gentleness.

I have no objection to about your harmless religion activities all day, but when you push a little bit of a secret of land, you feel like a retail devil. If you do religious work throughout the day, but if you deny the name of another, then what can you say! Undoubtedly you can be called a hypocrite and if your books teach these things, then your book is against the civilization. Everything that is contrary to the indigenous civilization is exclusion, I am against the constant adherence to these customs. The biggest scandal of the Hindu society is the system of 'caste' which is the worst system to see the same, the same language and the same culture to discriminate between people. When I received the Bramnin, I asked a question, 'Why the caste system was started on the basis of the work on the basis of birth today'! Most bremans avoid this or someone tries to give the gooseberries. If there is such a so-called superior or inferior division among people who worship the same God, then what do they think of other religions?

Therefore, let all kinds of castes and old traditions fall, humanity will be released and release humanity. Man's evaluation, according to his mentality and action, can be won by humanity.
